## üîç Overview

`CVE-2025-47789` identifies an **Open Redirect vulnerability** on the Horilla HRMS platform. The vulnerability is present in the login mechanism, where the `next` parameter in the URL is not properly validated, allowing redirection to arbitrary third-party domains.

This can be exploited by attackers to redirect users to **malicious or phishing websites**, posing risks such as session hijacking or credential theft.

## üß™ Proof of Concept (PoC)

```
https://demo.horilla.com/login/?next=https://example.com
```

### Steps to Reproduce:

1. Navigate to the above link.
2. (Optional) Log in with valid credentials.
3. Observe the automatic redirect to `https://example.com`.

Any attacker can substitute `example.com` with a phishing or malicious domain of their choice.

## üéØ Impact

- **Redirection to malicious payloads** or impersonation pages.
- **User data theft** via spoofed login pages.
- Could be weaponized in **email/social engineering campaigns**.

## üõ°Ô∏è Mitigation Recommendations

To address CVE-2025-47789:

1. Enforce that `next` only accepts **relative paths** (e.g., `/dashboard`).
2. Block or sanitize all absolute URLs (e.g., `https://...`).
3. If external redirects are necessary, implement a **strict allowlist**.

### Suggested Code Fix (Pseudocode)

```python
if not next_url.startswith('/'):
    next_url = '/dashboard'  # Fallback redirect
```
